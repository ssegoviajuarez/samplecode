1. Visualization sample: qcheckViz.Rdm   (https://github.com/ssegoviajuarez/qcheckViz)
   - qcheckViz ia a R Shiny dashboard to visualize the output from qCheck (a technical package for quality control of household surveys, comprehending variable-specific analysis in each dataset).
   - Dashboard needs the datasets include in this package to be visualized (See package)
   - Given the nature of the data used, dashboard cannot published in shinyapps.io, since data has restricted use.
   - To access to the qcheckViz dashboard (without opening the file and running it by yourself, run the following 2 lines in Rstudio console window.
        - install.packages(c("rmarkdown","flexdashboard","shiny"))
	- rmarkdown::run("LOCATION OF YOUR FILE/qcheckViz.Rmd")
   - Please write to: ssegoviajuarez@worldbank.org if questions arrive.

2. Writing sample: RegressionDiagnostics_SAE_SandraSegovia.pdf: 
  - Chapter written by Sandra Segovia for the upcoming "Guidelines to Small Area Estimation for Poverty Mapping"

    (See Closing Report from GSG1 Data for Policy Analysis (P169434) to see complete guidelines)
    *Note: The 3000 word count does not include the index nor the code extracts, althought it was also written by me.

3. Code samples:
   3.1 Code from qcheckViz.Rdm; written R (and Rshiny), Markdown, CSS and HTML.
   3.2 Code from module_creation.do
   - A do-file that create do-files with help of ASCII code and metadata of other dofiles.
