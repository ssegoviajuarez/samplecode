- **qcheckViz** ia a R Shiny dashboard to visualize the output from `qCheck`, a technical package for quality control of household surveys.
   - **NOTE:** This Dashboard needs datasets that are NOT included in this github account given data restrictions. For the same reason the dashboard cannot published in **shinyapps.io** just yet. Send email to author.
   
   - To access to the qcheckViz dashboard (without opening the file and running it by yourself) run the following 2 lines in Rstudio console window.
        
	 `install.packages(c("rmarkdown","flexdashboard","shiny"))`
	
	 `rmarkdown::run("LOCATION OF YOUR FILE/qcheckViz.Rmd")`
